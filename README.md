 This program allows a user to request either a funny, inspirational, or George Thiruvathukal patented quote. Simply by following the on-screen instructions, the program will choose a random quote from the requested type. Type F will provide a funny quote, I will provide an inspirational quote, and G will provide a George quote. After the provision of the quote, the program will exit and will need to be restarted for another quote.
