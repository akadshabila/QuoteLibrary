Going to church doesnt make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile (Billy Sunday)
Your limitation, Its only your imagination
Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you
Sometimes later becomes never do it now
Great things never come from comfort zones
Dream it wish it do it
Success doesn't just find you, you have to go out and get it
The harder you work for something the greater youll feel when you achieve it
Dream bigger Do bigger
Dont stop when youre tired stop when your done
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction
Do something today that your future self will thank you for
Little things make big days
Its going to be hard but hard does not mean impossible
Dont wait for opportunity, Create it
Sometimes were tested not to show our weaknesses but to discover your strengths
The key to success is to focus on goals not obstacles
